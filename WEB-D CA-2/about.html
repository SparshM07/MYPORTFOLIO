                        Hello! I'm a first-year college student pursuing my degree in Computer Science and Web Development. 
                        I have a strong passion for creating websites and learning new technologies. Throughout my academic journey, 
                        I've been exploring HTML, CSS, and various programming concepts to build a solid foundation in web development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe in continuous learning and improvement. Every project I work on is an opportunity to enhance my skills 
                        and gain practical experience. I'm excited about the future of technology and eager to contribute to meaningful 
                        projects that make a difference. In my free time, I enjoy reading tech blogs, watching coding tutorials, and 
                        working on personal projects to sharpen my abilities.
